# M1: MLOps Foundations

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to understand the basics of MLOps and implement a simple CI/CD pipeline for a machine learning project.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline
- Use a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to set up a pipeline for a sample machine learning project.
- Include stages for linting, testing, and deploying a simple machine learning model.

### 2. Version Control
- Implement version control for your project using Git.
- Demonstrate branching, merging, and pull requests.

---

## Deliverables

- **A report detailing the CI/CD pipeline stages.**
  - Explain the different stages of the pipeline, such as linting, testing, and deployment.
  
- **Screenshots or logs showing successful runs of the pipeline.**
  - Provide evidence that the CI/CD pipeline successfully ran with all stages passing.

- **A Git repository link with branches and merge history.**
  - Provide a link to your Git repository and ensure the history shows your work on branches and merges.
